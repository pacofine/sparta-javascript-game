Seb's Pong
================

Code for a four page application with the actual game platform designed on Canvas. A two-player, two-dimensional table tennis game inspired by the classic arcade game "Pong". 

## Purpose

This is a sample HTML5 / JS / CSS SPA (single Page Application).

Markup has been styled using Bootstrap.

It is intended as a demonstration of technical capabilities rather than design or helpful data.

Note also that it is a work in progress.

## Functionality

This is a simple application that displays several pages, including a cover page and three palyable pages.

The sample data is contrived, but shows how the data is stored in OOP format.

## Implementation

The functionality has been implemented using the following features:

* Bootstrap 3.2
* Javascript
* automated CI build on code repo change
* semantic HTML5
* well-structured CSS
